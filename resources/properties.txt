# This file defines the properties of each available environment.

# The valid properties are:
# - envID: positive integer begin from 1
# - resType: env | bnd | ply
# - width: desired width of the associated image in pixel
# - height: desired height of the associated image in pixel
# - nWalls: number of visible walls:
# - dist: horizontal distance between a wall and the next to it
# - nSprite: number of sprite into the associated image file
# - dir: directory in which there's the file
# - filename: the name of the file

# The properties must be ALL on the same line, separated by a single ';' character.

# Each line specifies the properties of an object given the envID and the resType. 
# These two properties must never miss. Also the dir and filename must never miss.

# The file are read from the current working dir (if one is given).
# The current working dir must be setted to './resources'
