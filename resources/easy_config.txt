# This file defines all the animation available for the Bird object.

# If you need to define more that one animation for the character you just
# say 'NEXT' between one animation and the next.

# You don't need to rewrite all the properties if the previous animation
# has already defined that properties, they are simply override.

# PAY ATTENTION: all the lines that don't begin with a character or that are empty 
# are ignored!!!
